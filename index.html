            Hi, my name is Oscar Condon. I'm a student from the Netherlands and this is my portofolio for coderclass. My hobby's are Tennis, gaming, coding and many other thing. I'm also good at piano and my favorite thing to do in coderclass is blender 3D where i model cool 3D objects in.

          <h2>What am I hoping to achieve in de coderclass?</h2>
          <p>
            I really want to continue learning Blender 3D, but it has a steap learning curve which makes it difficult for me to learn. I want to learn shading and geometry nodes. I'm also interested in learning sculpting, grease pencil and rigging, but that will take a long time so I'll do my best
